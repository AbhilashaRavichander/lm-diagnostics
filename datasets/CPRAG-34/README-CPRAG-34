These items come from the Federmeier and Kutas (1999) study.

The TSV file contains for each item the item ID, the context, three completion words, and the constraint category according to the original paper.

Expected completions are the highest cloze.
Within-category completions are approximately zero cloze but share a close semantic category with the expected word (e.g., sports). 
Between-category completions are approximately zero cloze and do not share the immediate semantic category with the expected word, but share a broader semantic category (e.g., games).

Constraint level indicates High or Low constraint bin, based on the cloze of the expected word, divided by a median split on the cloze values across items in the original experiment.
